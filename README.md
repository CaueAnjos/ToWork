# ToWork 📝✨

*Because "getting stuff done" sounds way too corporate*

A delightfully simple todo list that helps you transform your chaotic thoughts into organized productivity. No bells, no whistles, just pure task-crushing satisfaction.

## What's This All About? 🤔

ToWork is a straightforward todo list application that believes in the power of simplicity. It's for people who want to:
- Actually get things done (revolutionary concept, I know)
- Not spend 3 hours configuring their productivity app
- Feel that sweet dopamine hit when checking off completed tasks
- Avoid the existential dread of an empty todo list staring back at them
- Who is like me and love CLI tools 🤓

## Features 🚀

- ✅ Add tasks (groundbreaking!)
- ❌ Remove tasks (when you realize you don't actually need to "learn interpretive dance")
- 📝 Edit tasks (because "buy milk" sometimes becomes "buy oat milk for my lactose-intolerant lifestyle")
- 🎯 Mark tasks as complete (the best feeling in the world)
- 💾 Actually remembers your tasks (unlike your brain at 3 AM)

## Getting Started 🏃‍♂️

### Prerequisites
- A computer (preferably one that works)
- Basic survival instincts
- The will to be productive (I can't help you with this one)

### Installation

#### Option 1: Use the Pre-built Binary (Recommended for the Lazy Productive)
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/CaueAnjos/ToWork/releases) page
2. Extract it somewhere cozy on your system
3. Add the executable to your PATH (so you can summon it from anywhere like a productivity wizard)
4. Run `towork` from any terminal and watch the magic happen

#### Option 2: Build It Yourself (For the DIY Enthusiasts)
```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/CaueAnjos/ToWork.git

# Navigate to the project (like a responsible adult)
cd ToWork

# Building the release version (hang tight... dancing allowed once it’s done!)
dotnet publish -c Release

# The magic happens in bin/Release/net*/publish/
# Add that path to your PATH or just run it from there
```

## Usage 📖

1. Open the app
2. Use the commands to `add`, `remove`, `edit`, and `complete` tasks (or just type `-?` like an Ogre)
3. Add a task (try "kill ten thousand ants" - aim high!)
4. Complete the task (or don't, I'm not your boss)
5. Repeat until you become a productivity guru

## Contributing 🤝

3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
6. Wait patiently while I pretend to review it thoroughly (just kidding, I actually read them!)

## FAQ 🙋‍♀️

**Q: Why another todo app?**
A: Because the world needs simpler answers and fewer overcomplicated questions.

**Q: Will this make me more productive?**
A: Results may vary. Side effects may include: sudden urge to organize everything, buying fancy pens you'll never use, and telling people about your "productivity system."

**Q: Is this better than *todoist*, *tickcick* or *MS todo*?**
A: It's different. Sometimes different is exactly what you need 😎.

**Q: Why .NET for a todo app?**
A: Because sometimes you want your todo list to run fast and everywhere. Also, I like C#.
